# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview
Louiseâ€™s play Fever came close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. Now, she wants to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset we will visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. In this repo you will find, written reports based on our analysis and the visualizations we created.

## Analysis and Challenges

#### **Campaign Outcomes Based On Launch Date**

After analyzing the data and creating reports for campaign outcomes based on launch date, we can see that for the months from **Feburary** to **June** had the most successful campaigns. This tells us, that we will see a higher success rate and get a better result for running campagins during this months. 


However, you may notice that although **June** had a high number of successfull campaigns, it also had a high number of failed campaigns as well. Infact June was the **third** highest month of failed campaigns. To help us better understand our data visually, I decided to create a line chart displaying the percentage of successful, failed and cancled campaigns. 

As you can see, we can easily point out that months **Feburary** to **May** were the most successfull for campaign runs, floating between **57%-61%**. June however, drops to about **54%**. Which could be significant if the campaign has a huge budget and has **high impact.** 

Another important insight we can see is that from months **June** to **September** as the success rate for campaign run decresses the percentage of failed campaigns increases.

#### **Conculsion**: 
High budget and high impact campaigns should be run through **Feburary** to **May**, whereas low impact, low budget, low risk campagins, can be run throughout the rest of the months.
